//! SBML Level 3 Version 1 writer with FBC v2 and groups v1 extensions.
//!
//! Output is deliberately COBRApy-compatible: species get `M_` prefixes,
//! reactions `R_`, gene products `G_`. The `fbc:strict="true"` flag is set,
//! so every reaction must have `fbc:lowerFluxBound` and `fbc:upperFluxBound`
//! pointing at a `<parameter>`. Default-bound parameters are emitted once
//! (`cobra_default_lb`, `cobra_default_ub`, `cobra_0_bound`); reactions
//! whose bounds differ from defaults get dedicated per-reaction parameters.
//!
//! Only a writer is implemented in this milestone. Reading SBML is not
//! needed by gapseq-rs itself — every input comes from the CBOR/JSON
//! pipeline.
